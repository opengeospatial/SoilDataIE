# OGC Soil Data Interoperability Experiment

## UML Model (as XMI) 

XMI exports of UML packages used for the Soil Data IE information and requirements (use cases, architecture component diagrams) modelling.

A Sparx Enterprise Architect project containing these packages, and other common packages referred to by this work, is at enterprise-architect/soil-data-ie.eap.
